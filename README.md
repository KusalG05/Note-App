# flopkart

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

I intended to create a different app named flopkart, but eventually, it ended up being a note app. So there might be a discrepancy with the name of the app.

The notes will be displayed based on the recent edit time.

Let me show a tour for you:

Login or SignUp:
<br/>
<img src = "photos\Login Page.jpeg" alt = "Login" width = 200/>
<img src = "photos\SignUp.jpeg" alt = "SignUp" width = 200/>

Home Screen:
<br/>
<img src = "photos\Home.jpeg" alt = "Home" width = 200/>
<img src = "photos\slide.jpeg" alt = "Slider" width = 200/>

Create Note Screen(If you click on + in home screen):
<br/>
<img src = "photos\Empty Create.jpeg" alt = "CreateNote" width = 200/>
<img src = "photos\Create.jpeg" alt = "CreateNote" width = 200/>

Home Screen after saving:
<br/>
<img src = "photos\Home 2.jpeg" alt = "CreateNote" width = 200/>

Edit Note Screen(After clicking on pencil on note):
<br/>
<img src = "photos\Edit.jpeg" alt = "EditNote" width = 200/>

View Note Screen(After clicking on eye on note):
<br/>
<img src = "photos\View.jpeg" alt = "EditNote" width = 200/>

Delete Note:
<br/>
<img src = "photos\Delete.jpeg" alt = "DeleteNote" width = 200/>

I am currently working on pinning notes.
